			â€œHi, my name is Sneha Sathpathy, and I am a student of RMIT studying a Bachelor of IT. I took up a career in Information Technology after majoring in Psychology.<i></p>
			<p style="font-size:16px; color:#4f0d5e; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; font-family: Apple Chancery, cursive;">
			Accustomed to being around primarily adults, I have always been a lot more mature than my age. During my younger years, even my own friends found it to be an annoying quality of mine.<i></p>
			<p style="font-size:16px; color:#4f0d5e; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic; font-family: Apple Chancery, cursive;">
			A lot of people invested in me, and I excel because I take on board challenges and work to achieve my personal best. My perspective on life is that you can never be too small or too big for anything, if you set your mind on achieving those goals."<i></p>
